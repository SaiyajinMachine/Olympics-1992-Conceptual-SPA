# üéØ Gamified Quiz SPA

## üìù Project Overview

Welcome to **Gamified Quiz SPA**, a dynamic single-page application developed during the final project of the Code For All Fullstack Programming Bootcamp. Created within a 24-hour hackathon, this project draws inspiration from the iconic anthem "Barcelona" by Freddie Mercury & Montserrat Caball√©, famously performed at the 1992 Olympic Games.

This project embodies our passion for coding, creativity, and teamwork, blending fun, challenge, and technology into a memorable learning experience.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language driving the interactive features of the quiz.
- **HTML**: Structuring the web content and layout.
- **CSS**: Styling the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
